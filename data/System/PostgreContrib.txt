%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

In addition to a planned store implementation =PostgreContrib= provides a simple
connection cache using Perl DBI.

At the moment this is a just "companion contrib" for UnifiedAuthContrib.

%TOC%

---++ Prerequisites

=PostgreContrib= relies on the well known Postgre SQL server which does *not*
ship together with this contrib. Thus you have to install it with all its
dependencies by yourself.

For installation instructions other than Debian based distributions, refer to
the user or administration manual of your Linux distribution.

---+++ Debian Installation

First you have to install the Postgre SQL server and client applications as well
as Perl DBI and its Postgre driver.
<verbatim>
aptitude update
aptitude install postgresql postgresql-client libdbi-perl libdbd-pg-perl
</verbatim>

A system user called =postgres= will be created by Debian's =tasksel= script.
%BR%Switch to that user and create a new database user with the same name as
the web server user. For Debian based distributions this should be =www-data=.
%BR%Afterwards create two databases: =foswiki_store= and =foswiki_users=.%BR%

=foswiki_store= is currently unused but is planned to be used by a future store
implementation. =foswiki_users= holds all user information collected by
UnifiedAuthContrib.
<verbatim>
sudo -u postgres createuser www-data
sudo -u postgres createdb foswiki_store
sudo -u postgres createdb foswiki_users
</verbatim>

Ensure access to databases is granted to local users. To do so check
=/etc/postgresql/9.X/main/pg_hba.conf= for the following line
<verbatim>
local all all peer
</verbatim>

If it's not present you may add it as shown above or if you rather want to grant
access only to the web server user:
<verbatim>
local foswiki_store www-data trust
local foswiki_users www-data trust
</verbatim>

Finally reload the database server and enable its service during boot
<verbatim>
systemctl enable postgresql
systemctl restart postgresql
</verbatim>

---++ Non-local connections
Usually Foswiki will use a local socket connection for the DB. However you can configure a hostname/username/password for (remote) tcp connections. These are _expert_ options in configure.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---++ Using the Connection Pool
A database connection can be requested via static method
=PostgreContrib::getConnection=. This method takes as optional argument the
name of the database you'd like to connect to. It defaults to =foswiki_store=.
<verbatim>
...
use Foswiki::Contrib::PostgreContrib;
...
my $connection = Foswiki::Contrib::PostgreContrib::getConnection('foswiki_users');
my $db = $connection->{db};
...
$connection->finish();
</verbatim>
